QUICK RENDER By iEmby || Specially For MP4 Format Renders || Main Stream & Social Media
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Choice to pick from mostly used stream renders, including 4K, Full HD and Social Media.
- Choice to pick on basis of FPS.
- Choice to mute audio in render file.
- Choice to render selection or region.
- Choice to render only video tracks or audio Tracks.
- If you want to render at other templates besides quick ones then you can use Render Other Template Button.
- Choice to overwrite or not render output files.
- Choice to add template name with output files.
- Collect Project Media if you want. It is just like Project Archive. But it will work one project at one time.
  So for nested projects you have to open nested projects one by one using Open Nested Timeline Icon Button at   
  bottom toolbar and then open this script and run it again which is not so long process believe me.
- Open output folder if you want to check
- Rename output file before render
- Add Prefix with outful file before render
